/*
   You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. 
   Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint 
   stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security 
   system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent
   houses were broken into on the same night.

  Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of 
 each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without 
 alerting the police.
